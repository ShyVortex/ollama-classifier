It also explicitly states rapid battery drain, which falls under performance issues. However, the review also criticizes poor app building, which is vague. Considering the priority SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER, the battery drain is a clear performance issue, while uninstallation is a usability or feature issue. Since performance has higher priority, it should be selected. But note that the review also says 'poor app building' which might encompass multiple issues. However, the battery drain is specific and fits PERFORMANCE. The uninstallation part is a complaint but not as specific. Given the priority, PERFORMANCE is chosen over FEATURE or USABILITY. Also, the review has multiple issues but we must pick the most likely according to priority. The battery drain is a concrete performance issue, while uninstallation is a feature or usability issue. Since PERFORMANCE has higher priority, it is selected. However, note that the review also says 'poor app building' which is vague, but the battery drain is explicit. The uninstallation is mentioned as a problem but not as a specific technical issue. Therefore, the primary issue is performance. But wait, the review says 'can not uninstall' which is a usability issue because it affects user control and freedom. However, the priority list has PERFORMANCE above USABILITY. So PERFORMANCE is chosen. But let's check: the battery drain is ENERGY, which is under PERFORMANCE category? No, ENERGY is a separate category. In the priority, ENERGY is under PERFORMANCE category? Let's see: the priority is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. ENERGY is a sub-category of PERFORMANCE? No, ENERGY is listed separately. In the priority, PERFORMANCE and ENERGY are separate, but ENERGY is after PERFORMANCE. The review mentions battery drain, which is ENERGY. And uninstallation is a usability issue. Now, ENERGY has higher priority than USABILITY. So ENERGY should be selected over USABILITY. But the review says 'rapid battery drain' explicitly? Let's read: 'it wastes alot of battery' - that's ENERGY. And 'can not uninstall' is USABILITY. According to priority, ENERGY > USABILITY, so ENERGY should be selected. However, the review also says 'poor app building' which is vague. But the battery drain is specific. Also, the uninstallation is a problem but not as severe as battery drain in terms of priority. So ENERGY is the most likely. But wait, the category for battery drain is ENERGY, and for uninstallation is USABILITY. Since ENERGY has higher priority, it should be ENERGY. However, the review also says 'do not get this app' which is a general complaint, but that doesn't specify a category. So the main issues are battery drain (ENERGY) and uninstallation (USABILITY). Since ENERGY > USABILITY, ENERGY is selected. But note that the review says 'can not uninstall' which is a usability issue, and 'wastes alot of battery' which is ENERGY. So two issues, but ENERGY has higher priority. Therefore, the label should be ENERGY. However, let's confirm the categories: ENERGY is 'rapid battery drain, device overheating, or energy efficiency'. Yes, 'wastes alot of battery' fits ENERGY. And 'can not uninstall' is about user control, which is USABILITY. So ENERGY is selected. But the review also says 'poor app building' which might be a general complaint, but it's not specific. So the primary issue is ENERGY. Therefore, the category is ENERGY.",

The comment is about user experience, which falls under usability. However, since it is a generic positive review without specific technical feedback, it might lean towards OTHER. But according to the priority, OTHER is the lowest. Let's check: the review mentions 'easy to incorporate' and 'quickly share', which relates to user experience and performance. But it's not specific about speed or UI. The priority order is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. Since it's not a technical issue, it should be OTHER. However, 'quickly share' could imply performance, but it's not explicit. The review is positive and generic, so OTHER is appropriate. But let's see the exact categories. PERFORMANCE is for speed, etc., but here it's more about ease of use, which is usability. But the review doesn't detail any specific issue, just a positive remark. The priority says if ambiguous, choose the most likely. Here, it's not ambiguous in being a technical issue; it's a generic positive comment. So OTHER.

PERFORMANCE might be if it's about speed, but 'quickly' is vague. USABILITY is for comments on UI, etc., but this is more about the overall ease, which could be usability. However, the priority is to choose the most likely, and since it's positive, it's not a bug or feature request. The safest is OTHER because it's not a technical review.

However, the priority is BUG > PERFORMANCE, so if there is any bug, it should be labeled as BUG. The review has multiple issues, but the highest priority is BUG. Let's check: 'glitches' is a bug, 'gets location wrong' is a bug, 'freezes' is performance. Since BUG is higher priority, we should label it as BUG. But note: the review says 'glitches up my whole phone' which might be a system-wide issue, but still a bug. Also, 'gets location wrong' is a functional bug.

The safest approach is to use the OTHER category as a default for ambiguous cases, but the query itself is not a review. Since the input is invalid, I should not assign any category. But the system requires a label, so I must choose one. The priority rules don't apply here. I think the user meant to provide a review but forgot. In such cases, I should use OTHER to cover generic issues, but this is not a review. Alternatively, I could output an error, but the system requires a JSON output with a category. I must follow the instructions strictly. The input is 'Categorize: ? accurate and clear', which is not a review text. It's a meta-instruction. I should treat it as an invalid input and perhaps use OTHER, but that might not be accurate. Let's re-read the system prompt: 'assign a label to the given text, representing a user's review'. The given text is not provided. The user said 'Categorize: ? accurate and clear'. This is confusing. Perhaps the user intended to say 'Categorize: [some review] accurate and clear'. But as it is, there is no review. I think the best course is to use the OTHER category because the query is not a technical review and doesn't fit any specific category.

However, the priority order requires SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. Since neither SECURITY nor BUG is present, we consider PERFORMANCE for speed issues.

Given the priority, if there's a bug, it should be BUG, but here it's not specified as a bug. The second part 'it licks to fast' likely refers to the game's mechanics being too fast, which might be a performance issue or a design issue. But the first part is a feature request. Since the priority is to choose the most likely, and FEATURE is lower than PERFORMANCE, but in this case, the inability to change speed is a feature request, while 'licks too fast' might be a performance issue. However, the review does not explicitly state a bug or performance issue; it's more of a complaint about a missing feature and a design choice. According to the priority, FEATURE is lower than PERFORMANCE, but PERFORMANCE requires specific references to speed, etc. Here, 'licks too fast' could be interpreted as a performance issue.

However, the primary concern is the annoyance caused by the ad, which falls under usability as it affects the user experience. The ad is not functioning correctly, but the core issue is the user experience being degraded by the ad. According to the priority, usability is higher than feature or other, but since it's an ad issue, it might lean towards bug. However, the description does not specify a technical error but rather an annoyance. Considering the priority, BUG is higher than PERFORMANCE, ENERGY, etc., but this is not a crash or technical error. The ad is a feature (ads are part of the app), but the user is complaining about its behavior. The issue is that the ad is not behaving as expected, causing disruption. This could be classified as a BUG because it's a non-working feature (the ad is malfunctioning). Alternatively, it could be FEATURE if the user wants to remove it, but the review does not request a new feature. The review is a complaint about an existing feature not working properly. Therefore, it should be labeled as BUG. However, the priority order is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. Since it's not a security issue, but a bug, it fits. The ad popping up repeatedly is a malfunction, which is a bug. The user is annoyed, but the category is about the technical issue. So, BUG is appropriate. But let's check: the ad is part of the app, and if it's malfunctioning, it's a bug. Yes. The review does not mention security, performance, energy, or usability directly, but the ad issue inherently affects usability.

This indicates a technical issue with performance and usability, but the primary concern is the memory usage and the disruptive update process. However, the complaint about the update requiring a full reinstall and loss of data is more related to usability and potential performance issues. Considering the priority order, the memory issue falls under PERFORMANCE, while the update process issue is under USABILITY. But the text also mentions the cost and the need to pay again, which is a non-technical complaint. The most prominent issue is the memory consumption and the update process causing loss of data, which leans towards PERFORMANCE and USABILITY. However, the priority order dictates that if there's a performance issue, it should be selected first. The text says 'incredibly memory' which likely means high memory usage, falling under PERFORMANCE. The update issue is a usability problem. But the text also has financial complaints, which are OTHER. Since the priority is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER, and the memory issue is PERFORMANCE, that should be the label. However, the update issue is also significant. But the text says 'memory and $ greedy', so both are mentioned. The memory part is technical, the $ part is financial. The update process is a technical issue. But the priority is clear: if there's a performance issue, it takes precedence. The text says 'incredibly memory' which is likely a typo for 'memory' consumption, meaning high memory usage, which is PERFORMANCE. The update issue is about the way updates are handled, which is more of a usability issue. But the text also says 'developers have refused to reimburse' which is a financial complaint, falling under OTHER. However, the main technical issue is the memory usage. The text says 'incredally memory' probably meaning 'incredibly memory' consuming, so high memory usage. That is PERFORMANCE. The update issue is a separate issue, but the priority order has PERFORMANCE before USABILITY. So the label should be PERFORMANCE. But let's confirm: the text says 'incredibly memory' - likely meaning memory consumption is high, which is PERFORMANCE. The update issue is about the update process requiring full reinstall, which is a usability issue.

However, the instruction says to select the most likely label according to priority. BUG has higher priority than ENERGY. The review also includes a question about battery drain, but the main issue is the alarm not working. Therefore, the primary label is BUG. The battery drain is mentioned as a separate question, but the review starts with the alarm issue. Since the alarm issue is a concrete error, it should be labeled as BUG.

This indicates a problem with data management and storage, which falls under the category of usability or performance. However, the primary issue is the storage of unnecessary files, which affects the user experience by causing clutter and potential performance issues. Considering the priority, this is more related to usability due to the user interface for managing data and the overall user experience. But note that the storage issue could also be seen as a performance concern. However, the user specifically complains about the data not being cleaned up, which is a usability issue as it affects how the user interacts with the app. Also, the app's behavior of storing data in a proprietary format without cleanup is a bug, but the user is complaining about the lack of cleanup feature, which is a feature request. Let's re-evaluate: the user is not explicitly asking for a new feature but complaining about existing behavior. The core issue is that the app does not clean up data, which is a bug. However, the user's main concern is the space usage and the difficulty in managing files, which is usability. But the priority rule says BUG is higher than USABILITY. The text describes a bug in the app's behavior (not cleaning up data) which is a concrete error. Therefore, it should be labeled as BUG. However, the user also mentions that the storage is using a lot of space, which could be performance, but the primary complaint is the bug in data management. Let's check the categories: BUG is for errors, crashes, etc. The app not cleaning up data is an error in behavior, so it fits BUG. The user is not requesting a new feature, but complaining about a defect. So, the label should be BUG. But the user says 'i had to delete over 300 files' which implies that the app should have done it automatically, so it's a missing feature, which would be FEATURE. However, the text does not explicitly request a new feature; it complains about the current behavior. The priority rule says BUG > FEATURE, so if it's a bug, it should be BUG. The issue is that the app does not clean up data, which is a defect, so BUG. But the user is not directly reporting an error but complaining about the lack of a feature. Let's see the definitions: BUG is for concrete errors, non-working features. Here, the feature is not working as expected (i.e., not cleaning up), so it is a bug. Therefore, the label is BUG. However, the user might be implying a feature request, but the text is more about the current problem. The priority rule requires selecting the most likely label.

However, the priority order is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. Sound clarity issue is not a bug (no crash) nor security, but it could be considered performance if it's about speed of processing or latency in audio, but the description is about the output quality making it hard to understand, which is more about the feature's effectiveness. Since it's not a crash or security, and the user is not requesting a new feature but complaining about an existing one's quality, it fits under usability because it's about the user experience with the audio feature. The priority order places usability after performance, but this issue is not about speed or lag, so it's better to label as usability. However, let's check: the issue is with sound clarity, which is a quality issue. In the absence of a direct match, usability covers design and quality aspects of the interface. The user is not reporting a bug or crash, so not BUG. Not security. Not performance (since no mention of speed). Not energy. Not feature request. So usability is the best fit.

It also discusses low payouts and difficulties in obtaining items, which relate to gameplay mechanics but not technical issues. According to the priority, performance issues are addressed before usability or feature requests. However, the freezing is a clear performance issue, while the other parts are more about game design and monetization, which fall under OTHER. Since the review has multiple elements, we must choose the most likely label. Performance is a technical issue and should be prioritized over OTHER. But note that the freezing is explicitly a performance issue, while the other parts are not technical. However, the priority order is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. Since there is a BUG (freezing) and no other higher priority, we select PERFORMANCE. But wait, freezing is a BUG, not PERFORMANCE. Let's clarify: BUG is for concrete errors, crashes, etc., while PERFORMANCE is for speed, latency, etc. Freezing is a performance issue, but it can also be considered a bug. According to the definition, BUG covers crashes and freezes, while PERFORMANCE covers speed and smoothness. However, the priority order places BUG above PERFORMANCE. Let's recheck: the priority is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. So BUG is higher than PERFORMANCE. The review mentions 'freezes', which is a BUG. There is also a mention of difficulty and low payouts, which are not technical. But the primary technical issue is the freeze, which is a BUG. However, the review does not explicitly say it crashes, but freezes. According to the definition, BUG includes graphical glitches and non-working features, but freezing is typically a performance issue. Let's look at the definitions: BUG: Reports of concrete errors, crashes, graphical glitches, non-working features, or incorrect app behavior. PERFORMANCE: Specific references to speed, latency, smoothness, lag, temporary freezes, or excessive memory usage. So freezing is explicitly mentioned in PERFORMANCE. Therefore, the freeze is a PERFORMANCE issue. The other parts are about game design and monetization, which are not technical. So the main technical issue is PERFORMANCE. But note that the review says 'freezes alot', which is a performance issue. The monetization part is not technical. So we should label it as PERFORMANCE. However, the priority order is BUG > PERFORMANCE, but in this case, the freeze is classified under PERFORMANCE, not BUG. So we select PERFORMANCE. But wait, the definition of BUG includes 'non-working features' and 'incorrect app behavior'. Freezing could be seen as incorrect behavior. However, the definition of PERFORMANCE explicitly includes 'temporary freezes'. So it's clear that freezing falls under PERFORMANCE. Therefore, the label should be PERFORMANCE. However, the review also has non-technical complaints, but the primary technical issue is the freeze. Since there is a PERFORMANCE issue, and no higher priority, we select PERFORMANCE. But note that the review has multiple issues, but we must choose the most likely label. The freeze is a PERFORMANCE issue, while the other parts are not technical. So the category is PERFORMANCE. However, let's confirm: the freeze is a technical issue, and it's under PERFORMANCE. The other parts are about game design and monetization, which are not technical, so they don't affect the category. Therefore, the label is PERFORMANCE. But wait, the review says 'alot' which might be a typo, but that's irrelevant. So final decision: PERFORMANCE.",

There is no explicit request for a new feature. The priority order is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. Since this is not a technical issue, it should be OTHER. However, the review does mention features, but without a request, it is not a FEATURE. The category for comments on features without a request is OTHER. But the instruction says: 'FEATURE': Explicit requests for new features. This is not an explicit request; it is a statement of satisfaction. Therefore, it should be OTHER. But let's see the priority: OTHER is the last category. Since there are no technical issues, OTHER is appropriate. However, the review is about features, but not requesting new ones. The category 'FEATURE' is only for explicit requests. This is not an explicit request, so it is not FEATURE. It is a generic positive review. So OTHER is correct.

The category for comments on features is not explicitly defined, but according to the priority, if it is not a technical issue, it goes to OTHER.

But the specific issues like formatting changes and corrupted images are graphical glitches, which are BUGs. The non-working notifications are a BUG. The performance issue is PERFORMANCE. The feature request is FEATURE. Since BUG has higher priority than PERFORMANCE and USABILITY, and the review contains multiple BUGs (UI glitches, non-working notifications), the label should be BUG. But note that the review also has a feature request and performance issue, but they are lower priority. However, the primary issue is the BUGs in the UI. The review says 'the ui needs work' but also describes specific bugs. According to the priority, BUG is higher than USABILITY and FEATURE. So the label should be BUG. But let's confirm: The BUG category is for concrete errors, crashes, etc. The UI glitches and non-working notifications are concrete errors. The performance issue is separate. Since there are BUGs present, and the priority is high, BUG should be selected. However, the review also has a feature request, but that is lower priority. So the label is BUG.",

The review doesn't explicitly say the text selection is broken, but it says it 'often disrupts reading accidentally', which implies it's not functioning as intended, so it's a BUG. The black background is a design choice, which is USABILITY. Since BUG has higher priority, we choose BUG. However, the review also says 'the interface is poor', which might be more broadly USABILITY. But the specific bug is the text selection. According to the priority, BUG is higher, so we choose BUG. But let's see the exact categories: BUG is for concrete errors, crashes, etc. The text selection issue is a concrete error in functionality. The black background is not an error, it's a design choice. So the primary issue is BUG. Therefore, the label is BUG.",

However, the main issue is the browser not remembering form data, which is a functional limitation. This falls under feature requests as it's a missing functionality. According to the priority, FEATURE is considered, but PERFORMANCE is mentioned first. Since the primary concern is the absence of a feature, it should be FEATURE. However, the speed comment is about performance. But the main issue is the feature gap. Let's check the priority: SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. The main issue is FEATURE, but PERFORMANCE is higher priority. The review has both performance (speed) and feature (missing form data). The speed is described as 'awesome', so it's positive, not a complaint. The form data issue is the complaint. Since the complaint is about a missing feature, it should be FEATURE. But the priority says PERFORMANCE is higher. However, the text says 'my only problem' is the form data, so the primary issue is the feature. According to the rule, if ambiguous, choose the most likely according to priority. The priority order is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. The issue is not a bug, not security, not performance (since speed is praised), not energy, not usability (not mentioned), not feature (missing feature), so it's feature. But the priority says FEATURE is lower than PERFORMANCE. However, in this case, the PERFORMANCE aspect is positive, so it's not a complaint about performance. The complaint is solely about the missing feature. Therefore, the label should be FEATURE. But let's confirm: the review says 'my only problem is that the browser doesn't seem to remember form data'. This is a feature request. The speed is not an issue. So, it's FEATURE. However, the priority rule says to choose the most likely according to the priority order. The issue is FEATURE, but PERFORMANCE is higher. But since the PERFORMANCE part is not problematic (it's awesome), the complaint is only about FEATURE. So, we should go with FEATURE. But the rule says: 'if a review is ambiguous or contains multiple issues, select the most likely label according to the priority'. Here, there is one complaint about a feature. The speed is not a complaint. So, it's not ambiguous in terms of having multiple issues; it's one issue: missing feature. Therefore, it should be FEATURE. But the priority order has PERFORMANCE above FEATURE, but in this case, PERFORMANCE is not an issue. So, we should ignore the positive part and focus on the complaint. The complaint is FEATURE. So, label is FEATURE. However, let's see the exact categories. FEATURE is for explicit requests for new features. This is an implicit request, but still, it's a feature request. So, I think FEATURE is correct. But the priority rule might be applied only when there are multiple issues. Here, there is one complaint. So, no ambiguity. Therefore, label is FEATURE. But the review also mentions speed positively, but that doesn't affect the label. So, final decision: FEATURE.",

The WiFi issue might be a bug, but the message saving could be a bug or a feature. The double-tap is a feature request. However, the priority order is SECURITY > BUG > PERFORMANCE > ENERGY > USABILITY > FEATURE > OTHER. The bug (WiFi issue) is a BUG, the feature request is FEATURE.

But the category is specific: BUG for errors, crashes, etc. Performance for speed, etc. The WiFi issue might be a performance issue if it's about speed, but the user says 'won't work in wifi as good', which might be a bug.

According to the priority, if there's a bug or performance issue, it would take precedence, but here the issues are not critical. The loudness issue could be a bug if it's a technical error, but it's not specified. The lack of auto-rotate is a feature request.

These are technical complaints about the app's current state, but they are not specific to bugs, security, performance, energy, or usability in a way that fits the categories. The aging web interface and lack of features could be considered usability or feature-related, but the priority rule places FEATURE last, and the review does not explicitly request a new feature. The lack of features is more of a complaint than a request. Considering the priority, the most prominent issue is the aging web interface, which falls under usability. However, the review also criticizes the lack of updates and new features, which might lean towards FEATURE, but the priority is lower. Since the review is ambiguous, we must choose the most likely label. The aging interface is a usability issue, and the lack of features is a feature request but not explicit. Given the priority, usability is higher than feature. But the review does not explicitly request a new feature; it just complains about missing features. The primary issue mentioned is the aging web interface, which is a usability problem. The lack of new features is secondary. Therefore, the label should be USABILITY. However, let's check the categories: the aging interface is about the UI, which is usability. The lack of features is a feature gap, but the priority for FEATURE is lower. Since the review is positive overall but critical on some points, and the critical points are about the UI and missing features, but the missing features are not explicitly requested, so it's not a FEATURE request. The complaint about the web interface being aging suggests it needs improvement, which is usability. The lack of import/export and subtasks are feature gaps, but again, not explicitly requested. The priority rule says to choose the most likely, and since the review does not explicitly request a new feature, it's not a FEATURE. The main issue is the aging interface, which is usability. Also, the review does not mention bugs, security, performance, etc. So, the label is USABILITY. But wait, the review says 'lack of proper subtasks' and 'no new features', which could be interpreted as a feature request, but it's not explicit. The priority for FEATURE is lower than USABILITY, so we should not choose FEATURE unless it's explicit. Here, it's not explicit, so USABILITY is more appropriate. However, the review also says 'it loses a star for the aging web interface', which is a direct usability complaint. The other issues are about missing features, but they are not framed as requests.
