12,an excellent offline rss reader on my nexus 7. a solid  simple  lightweight reader. the only feature i miss compared with my desktop reader is the ability to group feeds in folders. thanks are due to the author.  this is an open source program and there are similar apps based on it. if you have one of these installed  as i had  uninstall it first or you get a 'duplicate' error.  this is not a web-based reader like google reader  but you can import your feeds as an opml file.,FEATURE

17,ok i guess just fix the start up bug it is getting annoying,BUG
18,pretty good the app is pretty good  but the new sms feature is not acceptable.  i was very excited when i saw the update  but now i am disappointed. it works in its very essence  but even then it's very clumsy. things like only allowing the text being sent to one person  not allowing the ringing the editing of the recipient after initial insertion  etc. the text messages take forever to actually be sent. plus  it's an eyesore compared to the rest of the app. the cursor and send button are white on a white background and so are difficult to see...at least make it black to match. it's clear to me that they threw it in last second without much testing.,USABILITY

23,any time avialable for read the bible;very good app. superb app,OTHER
24,straightforward  useful very useful for what it should do  and the basic functionality is great. i do like the any.do moment feature  which asks you to plan out your day. the interface for the companion calendar  cal  is incredible  while any.do is just decent - nothing special. the big complaint i have  then  is a lack of sub-tasks  and a relatively difficult interface for viewing or editing anything more than a task title (e.g. notes or locations or reminders are all a tad difficult to access). overall  though  not bad at all,USABILITY
25,my go to weather app after trying other apps  i keep going back to this as my go to weather app. efficient use of battery  great visuals  and beautiful widgets. i tried to get the temperature over seas but it wouldn't let me  that would be my only concern  but i can find that elsewhere if pressing. great job! using paranoidandroid 2.53 on samsung vibrant.,FEATURE
26,the app is good for 30 seconds... it's not only the app that has some serious bugs  it's also the website & mobile view. i keep having to force close the app after 30 seconds. i have this app on my s4 - nexus5 - note3 all facing the same issue.  the app is  seriously suckish guys fix it  and fix your website aswel. it's like you guys are paying for the wrong staff? f**k all the design bs it looks alright. focus on all your optimisations  some fixes are just seriously basic!,BUG

37,i love it  but... i use smart launcher for months  i love how it consume less memory than other launchers and without lack of features. but one thing that bothers me sometimes is that the screen transition between home screen and the drawer is not smooth enough. i hope you guys see my review and get it done. overall  5 stars!,USABILITY
38,beautiful widget. only problem i think is inspite of turning gps off  the app is continuously using it as shown by my battery usage statistics.,BUG
39,whoah :0 i love the show i love the app though i suck if only it were easier to get more coins. i have had some irritating issues with the app though. when a play a song i just bought it sort of freezes and if i get out of the app and back in it doesn't count it like i had play it  so it doesn't give me coins and its happened more than once  that part gets annoying to me.,BUG
40,no copy text feature this app is good  but i just wish it would allow me to copy text from pdfs.  sometimes i need to paste text from a pdf document into a word document.  i find this lack of functionality quite frustrating.  if the developers add this feature i would give this app 5 out of 5 stars.,FEATURE

46,excellent app.  clean and easy to use. ?,OTHER
47,good for unreliable connections. ui needs work the only android client to implement xep-0198  for reliable messaging over unreliable connections. this requires support from your xmpp server -- e.g prosody with the unofficial mod_smash module -- and your colleagues im clients -- e.g. gajim  and gibberbot itself. many of the most popular xmpp servers and clients still lack this critical feature (looking at you  ejabberd  pidgin  xabber). it would be good if other software projects started to take these stream management extensions more seriously  especially as gtalk  with its proprietary stream management  looks like it's biting the dust. we need clients gibberbot (and gajim etc) to get things moving on this front. there are issues with gibberbot. the ui needs work (e.g. the formatting of the chat window changes randomly when scrolling up and down; the background image can be corrupted when touching the screen; there is no option to select a different notification sound  and notifications don't always work with open chats)  and sometimes it takes time to negotiate a connection. xabber has a better ui (and is gpled  hint hint)  but if you must have reliable and secure xmpp messaging on the move  this is currently your only choice.,USABILITY

61,bad for battery i had to revise my rating. it sucks too much battery.  i have 50% left and before installing i would have 80-90% left.,ENERGY
62,good app  but lacks important updates i love this app. it does exactly what it's suppose to do. it tracks runs  bike rides  and other forms of moving exercises. the data is quick to get to and the running screen is easy to read and see all the important info at a glance.  unfortunately  they're slow with updating the app to use android's latest features. specifically bluetooth low energy for heart rate monitors. i understand not everyone is on android 4.3+ but for those of us who are  the lack of ble support is discouraging  given how important heart rate info can be when training. for this reason  i've moved over to mapmyfitness which supports bluetooth low energy heart rate monitors. once runkeeper brings in ble support  i'll switch back as i like the app better.,FEATURE
63,freezes on loss screen would love to unlock the alpha goggles but lucky this app is trash.,BUG
64,drm ruins the experience the licensing issue in this game completely ruined my experience with the game. those of you looking to purchase the game must be warned the google play license error message shows up after an hours play and force stops the app. if you wish to keep playing you must download and re-install the app again only to have the same process repeat itself after another hours play. an issue the developer is unwilling to fix after unresponsive bad customer service.,BUG
